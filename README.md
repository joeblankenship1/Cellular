# An Introduction to Cellular Communications

I currently teach this at the Tampa Hackerspace. Please feel free to share, fork, and use my materials for educational purposes.

I also urge you to create wiki pages so we can improve the course content with additional reference material.

If there are any other issues or concerns with the materials, please let me know.

Thanks and enjoy learning!
